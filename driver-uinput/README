GfxTablet network manager daemon.
Protocol version 1.0 -- quadcore-dev proposed commit.

This code has been modified from it's original source on
GitHub -- https://github.com/edtrind/GfxTablet-master
Author:  bitfire web engineering/GfxTablet -- Richard Hirner

This version provides higher compatability for GIMP (by
converting the output values to larger ones so that the
pressure curve function becomes usable in "Input Settings"
-> "Network Tablet".

It also contains some eyecandy, a visible pressure bar that
indicates how hard your last stroke was.  It does not spam
your terminal window with the events, but will exit with
an error code if there is a problem.

This code was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Studio and is
verified working on this platform.

I am not responsible if my code causes your GfxTablet
daemon to stop functioning, your computer to catch fire,
or your pets to die from said fire, etc.
